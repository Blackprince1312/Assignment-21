### Backbone, React, Refactor

For the most part, every assignment so far has had you creating something from scratch. However, in the real world you will most likely join a team that has an existing code base. You will need to be able to jump in and start refactoring their existing _legacy_ code. The idea here is for you to take an app break it apart into react components.


### Learning Objectives

- Understand Backbone and React and where each fits in the ecosystem.
- Ability to work on an existing code base

## Normal Mode

##### Convert an Existing App to React

* Fork this [repo](https://github.com/tiy-lv-frontend-2015-10/ReactRefactor) to your own Github account
* Once forked, clone it to your local computer
* You will need to manually run `npm install`
* You will need to install webpack `npm install -g webpack`
* Modify the __js/parse-credentials.json__ file to use your own account
* Before making other changes, fire up `webpack-dev-server` in your console and visit `localhost:8080`
* Take a minute to understand what the app does
* Convert the app to __use react__ for the views
* After converting it to react, push to your github repo and then make a __pull request__ back to the original repo.


### Deliverables

* A link to your Pull Request.
* A link to your deployed `gh-pages` or `surge.sh` page.
